## WebFetch

**Input Schema:**

```
object:
  - url (required):
    string
      # The URL to fetch content from
  - prompt (required):
    string
      # The prompt to run on the fetched content
```

**Description:**


- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions. All MCP-provided tools start with "mcp__".
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large
  - Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL
  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.


## WebSearch

**Input Schema:**

```
object:
  - query (required):
    string (minLength: 2)
      # The search query to use
  - allowed_domains (optional):
    array:
      items:
        string
      # Only include search results from these domains
  - blocked_domains (optional):
    array:
      items:
        string
      # Never include search results from these domains
```

**Description:**


- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Web search is only available in the US
  - Account for "Today's date" in <env>. For example, if <env> says "Today's date: 2025-07-01", and the user wants the latest docs, do not use 2024 in the search query. Use 2025.
