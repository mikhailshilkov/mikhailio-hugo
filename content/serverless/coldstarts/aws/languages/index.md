The following chart shows the typical range of cold starts in AWS Lambda, broken down per language. The darker ranges are the most common 67% of durations, and lighter ranges include 95%.

{{< chart_interval
    "coldstart_aws_bylanguage"
    "Typical cold start durations per language" >}}

The charts below give the distribution of cold start durations per supported programming language. All charts (except the last one) have the same horizontal scale (0.0-1.0 sec) to make them easily comparable.

**JavaScript**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_js"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in JavaScript"
     "1.0" >}}

**Python**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_python"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in Python"
     "1.0" >}}

**Java**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_java"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in Java"
     "1.0" >}}

**Go**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_go"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in Go"
     "1.0" >}}

**Ruby**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_ruby"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in Ruby"
     "1.0" >}}

**C#**:

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_csharp"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda in C# (2 GB RAM)"
     "1.0" >}}

**Docker image** (notice that the scale of X axis is different from the other charts):

{{< chart_hist
     "coldstart_aws_docker"
     "Cold start durations of AWS Lambda packages as a Docker image"
     "1.8" >}}
